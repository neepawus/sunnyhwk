		<p>A noun is something that is concrete, such as a person, animal, or anything we can see, hear, touch, etc..  A noun is also something less concrete, such as a party, ceremony, meeting, thought, etc..</p>

	<div id="lesson2.3" class="section">
		<p>Nouns in Wôpanâôt8âôk have two categories. These categories are <strong>Animate</strong> and <strong>Inanimate</strong>.</p>

		<p>An animate noun is abbreviated as <strong>NA</strong></p>
		<p>An inanimate noun is abbeviated as <strong>NI</strong></p>

		<div>

	<div class="section">
		<p>It is not always obvious which noun is animate and which is inanimate.</p>  
		<p>For example, the human body itself is considered animate, while most of the separate body parts are considered inanimate.  And there are some nouns that are considered both animate and inanimate.</p>
		<p>For now, we'll tell you if the noun is animate and inanimate</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h2>Plurals</h2>
		
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<p>Plural means more than one.</p>
		<p>For this lesson, we'll be learning how to make nouns plural. Meaning we'll be learning how to say the Wôpanâak equivalent of "duck" vs "ducks"</p>

	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<p>If a noun is inanimate the plural is <strong>ash</strong></p>

		<p>Example:</p>
		<p>katum8 - year</p>
		<p>katum8ash - years</p>

		<p>week - house</p>
		<p>weekash - houses</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<p>If the noun is animate the plural is <strong>ak</strong></p>

		<p>Example:</p>
		<p>ashk8k: snake</p>
		<p>ashk8kak: snakes</p>

		<p>anaquhs - star</p>
		<p>anaquhsak - stars</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<p>Make plurals of the following nouns. Write the plural form next to the noun.</p>
	</div>


<div class="section">
<p>ahkee, ‘land, earth’ NI
keesuq, ‘sky, heavens’ NI
anaquhs, ‘star’ NA
week, ‘house’ NI
nupee, ‘water’ NI
nupuhsupâq, ‘lake, pond, pool’ NI
mutumwuhsuhs, ‘woman’ NA
mây, ‘road, path’ NI
muhtuq, ‘tree’NI
ahsun, ‘stone’ NI</p>
</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h2>Hiders</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<p>Many nouns in Wôpanâôt8âôk have final syllables that are not pronounced if there is nothing behind the syllable, such as a plural.</p>

		<p>This is whether or not there is a truncated final sound on the noun.</p>

		<p>On some Wampanoag nouns, you might see syllables that appear in parenthesis at the end of the word.  These are all truncating finals. We like to call them hiders and we will be referring to them as such in lessons.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<p>For example: seep means river.</p>
		<p>The full form of the noun is seep8. But when we're talking about one river we just say seep. If we're talking about two rivers we keep that hidden ending and say seep8ash.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<p>Make plurals of the following nouns. Write the plural form next to the noun.</p>
	</div>

<div class="section">
<p>mahkus(un), ‘shoe’ NI
mônâk(un), ‘cloth, coat, sheet’ NI
ahsh8nôk8(un),’hat’ NI 
kuhtah(an), ‘ocean’ NI
nôkushq(â), ‘girl’ NA
seep(8), ‘river’ NI
munah(an), ‘island’ NI
nôpak8(un), ‘bracelet, jewel, treasure’ NI
sakahsâh8(un), ‘earring’ NI
wunôk(an), ‘dish, bowl’ NI
wutatamwâeech(8), ‘cup’ NI
peetôk(an), ‘purse, pouch’NI
qusuq(an),’rock’ NI
tayôshq(ôn), ‘bridge’ NI</p>
</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h2>(ay) hiders</h2>
		<p>The exception!</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<p>Whenever there is a hider (ay) and the noun is inanimate, the hider does not show up at all when we add a plural.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<p>Example:</p>
		<p>Town: 8tân(ay) NI</p>
		<p>plural: 8tânash</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<p>We won't show you any animate nouns with the hider (ay) just yet. It is important to know however, that the animate nouns with this hider also do something odd.  For example, take the noun stem Nâmôn(ay), ‘son’.  If we want to say ‘my sons’, we would say nunâmônôk.  Here the hider (ay) combines with the animate plural ending –ak and gives us –ôk.  But remember, this is only for animate nouns that end in a hider (ay).</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<p>Make plurals of the following nouns. Write the plural form next to the noun.</p>
	</div>

<div class="section">
<p>8tân(ây), ‘town’ NI</p>
</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h2>(âw) Hider</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<p>Sometimes a noun has a hider (âw).  Whenever this is the case, we must remember that the w of (âw) goes away when we add the plural.  For example:	Washkeetôp, ‘man’	Washkeetôpâak, ‘men’</p>

		<p>One of the things you will learn is that many Ws in this language will disappear when they are preceded by a long vowel, like â, and are followed by another sound.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<p>Make plurals of the following nouns. Write the plural form next to the noun.</p>
	</div>

<div class="section">
<p>washkeetôp(âw), ‘man’ NA
nôkôp(âw), ‘boy’ NA
kunam(âw), ‘spoon’ NA</p>
</div>


	<div class="section">
		<p> Great Job! We're almost done</p>
		<p>Make plurals out of all the words we've learned today</p>
