  <title>Wôpanâak: Lesson 2</title>
</head>
<body>

A noun is something that is concrete, such as a person, animal, or anything we can see, hear, touch, etc..  A noun is also something less concrete, such as a party, ceremony, meeting, thought, etc..

Nouns in Wôpanâôt8âôk have two categories. These categories are <strong>Animate</strong> and <strong>Inanimate</strong>.

An animate noun is abbreviated as <strong>NA</strong>
An inanimate noun is abbeviated as <strong>NI</strong>

It is not always obvious which gender a Noun is classified.  For example, the human body itself is considered animate, while most of the separate body parts are considered inanimate.  And there are some nouns that are considered both animate and inanimate.  

Plural means more than one.

For this lesson, we'll be learning how to make nouns plural. Meaning we'll be learning how to say the Wôpanâak equivalent of "duck" vs "ducks"



If a noun is inanimate the plural is <strong>ash</strong>

Example: 
katum8 - year
katum8ash - years

week - house
weekash - houses

If the noun is animate the plural is <strong>ak</strong>

Example: 
ashk8k: snake
ashk8kak: snakes

anaquhs - star
anaquhsak - stars


Truncated Finals
Many nouns in Wôpanâôt8âôk have final syllables that are not pronounced if there is nothing behind the syllable, such as a plural.



This is whether or not there is a truncated final sound on the noun.    And this is what we mean by truncated.  

On your vocabulary list from lesson one, you will see many nouns with syllables that appear in parenthesis.  These are all truncating finals.

For example, 

seep means river.
The full form of the noun is seep8. But when we're talking about one river we just say seep.
If we're talking about two rivers we keep that hidden ending and say seep8ash. 

If we want to add anything to the end of a noun that has a truncating final, we call them ‘hiders’, we must add after the hider.  

Exception
There is one noun on your list 8tân(ay), ‘town’ that has a hider of (ay).  Whenever there is a hider (ay) and the noun is inanimate, the hider does not show up at all when we add a plural. 

So when we want to say towns, we say 8tânâsh.

We don’t have any animate nouns on our vocabulary list that have a hider (ay).  It is important to know however, that the animate nouns with this hider also do something odd.  For example, take the noun stem
Nâmôn(ay), ‘son’.  If we want to say ‘my sons’, we would say nunâmônôk.  Here the hider (ay) combines with the animate plural ending –ak and gives us –ôk.  But remember, this is only for animate nouns that end in a hider (ay).


O.K. there is only one more thing we need to talk about before we make plurals of our noun list.  Sometimes a noun has a hider (âw).  Whenever this is the case, we must remember that the w of (âw) goes away when we add the plural.  For example:	Washkeetôp, ‘man’	Washkeetôpâak, ‘men’
One of the things you will learn is that many Ws in this language will disappear when they are preceded by a long vowel, like â, and are followed by another sound.


For lesson #2 we will make plurals of all of the nouns on the vocabulary list. 

Make plurals of the following nouns. Write the plural form next to the noun.

mahkus(un), ‘shoe’ NI
mônâk(un), ‘cloth, coat, sheet’ NI
ahsh8nôk8(un),’hat’ NI 
ahkee, ‘land, earth’ NI
