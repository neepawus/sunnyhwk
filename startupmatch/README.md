## FEWD Week #3: Advanced Topics in CSS

<br>

### Description

During Class 6, we're going to start building the Startup Matchmaker website.  We'll be building it using **Responsive Web Design** techniques and following the **mobile-first** approach.  That means, we'll be building the mobile version of our site and then enhancing using **media queries** for progressively larger screens.

For your homework for Class 5, create a basic website that will be our mobile site skeleton:

1. Add the [Google Font Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) with the light and regular styles and set it as the base page font.
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat:200,400" rel="stylesheet">
```
2. Set up your base page with the following structure:
```
  <nav></nav>
  <section></section>
  <section></section>
  <section></section>
  <section></section>
  <footer></footer>
```
3. Give each of the sections and id as follow: how, openings, startups, join.  We'll be using these later as anchors for our menu, but they are useful for distiguishing the sections in our CSS as well.
4. Set the page background color to: #7c7d7f.
5. Set the nav background color to: #213b6e and link color to white.
6. Set the #how background to the launch.jpg image and make sure it spans the entire viewport height and font color to white.  Make the background color of the box behind the text rgba(20,93,125,.5);
7. Set the #openings font color to #222.
8. Set the #startups background color: #fac16f and font color to: #ce7800.
9. Set the #join background color to: #17898e and font color to: #ccc.
10. Give the footer a background color of: #222 and font color of: #ccc.
11. Make the boxes in the openings section using divs with flexbox and flexwrap.
12. Make the logos in a grid if you can!
